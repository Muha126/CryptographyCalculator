## üìå About The Project

Cryptography Calculator looks like a regular math calculator... until you enter the secret code.

Once triggered, it allows you to:
- Input sensitive text
- Asymmetrically encrypt it (using RSA 2048)
- Store the encrypted data in an SQLite database
- Write the private key to a connected USB drive
- Later decrypt the data by inserting the USB with the key file

If encrypted data exists in the database, it prompts for a key to decrypt and display it, with options to delete or close.

> Use it to hide sensitive notes, passwords, or secrets on shared computers without raising suspicion.
